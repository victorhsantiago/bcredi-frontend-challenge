# BCredi Frontend Challenge

> <cite>"Superbly inspirational phrase here"</cite> - Really Smart, Someone ðŸŒŸ

<p>
  This project was developed as part of my recruitment proccess at <strong>BCredi</strong>. The intent of this project is to provide a snmall sample of my development skills as a software developer to the amazing peeps that are evaluating me. ðŸ˜‰
</p>
<p>
  As the developer responsible for this project I must say that I tried to show the best of my abilities here, but due to time restraints, I had to use a few libraies to speed up the development proccess. I'd like to add that if possible I'd have coded the whole project only using JavaScript, HTML and CSS, not only because it's something the evaluators would like to see, but seeing that I really enjoy coding stuff by myself.
</p>
<p>
  About the tecnologies used in this project I decided to go with VueJS, the main reason for that decision is that it's the framework that I'm most familiar with. The bad side of this approach is that I couldn't show as many vanilla Javascript code as possible.
</p>
<p>
  I also would like to add that, as asked in the test, I didn't over commit on componentizing the application, I tried to keep it simplier for the sake of code purity, but I followed the basic recommendations for developing a SPA.
